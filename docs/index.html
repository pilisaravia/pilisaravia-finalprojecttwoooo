        <p>
          As a dedicated journalism student at the University of Texas, I am
          passionate about storytelling. Throughout my academic career so far, I
          have served as a reporter and associate news editor at The Daily
          Texan, the (awesome) UT student newspaper. I also had the opportunity
          of interning at Houston Public Media, where I dove into daily
          reporting, Ballotpedia, where I learned more about staying objective,
          and KUT, where I worked on a months-long multimedia feature story.
          Through it all, I have stayed committed to pursuing a journalistic
          career that allows me to use my skills to inform, educate and empower
          others. I also strayed from journalism to expand my knowledge on
          skills that could later help my reporting by minoring in government
          and business, along with taking the coding class that allowed me to
          code this website (Hi and thank you, Professor McDonald)! I am eager
          to connect with other professionals in the industry and learn from
          their experiences.

      <p>
        As I popped another chocolate chip into my mouth after a day of 9th
        grade summer classes, I watched 16-year-old Carrie Bradshaw land her
        first job at Interview Magazine on my television. As opposite as our
        worlds were, The-Carrie-Diaries-star and I had one thing in common: we
        were both falling in love with the world of journalism. Once the next
        school year began, I dove head first into my journalism classes,
        subscribed to all the fashion magazines I could afford and watched Anna
        Wintour on my mom's MasterClass account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, 2020 brought this glamour to a halt. My phone screen changed
        from fashion to news of a pandemic, photographs of protests and quotes
        from the presidential candidates. I immediately saw the journalist
        behind the works and recognized the immense responsibility and strength
        that each reporter carried. It was because of them that we could unite
        in a world-wide pandemic and practice honest democracy in a confusing
        election. That is when I knew that my dream of becoming a journalist was
        real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I am lucky enough to live out this dream. I started reporting for
        The Daily Texan within my first month at The University of Texas, where
        I learned to shine a light on unseen issues and inequities affecting our
        community. I eventually deepened my passion for reporting on these
        matters and expanded my knowledge on how to report them.
      </p>
      <p>
        My colleague and I placed second on a Texas Intercollegiate Press
        Association award for our coverage on one of the first Palestine
        protests at UT following the October 2023 attack. ​I saw my stories
        about protestors and Senate Bill 17, a bill banning diversity equity and
        inclusion practices in Texas public universities, featured in activists'
        petitions, letters and panels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then tried radio for the first time at Houston Public Media. My
        coverage on the effects of Hurricane Beryl in Houston zoomed into
        homeowners with debris, restaurant-owners with closed shops and unpaid
        employees and regular park goers. A couple radio pieces were played in
        the state-wide NPR stations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I go further into my career, I hope to find a community to stick with
        to truly create a bond and trust with the people we serve. Please feel
        welcome to reach out and begin connecting!
