        <p>
          As a dedicated journalism student at the University of Texas, I am
          passionate about storytelling. Throughout my academic career so far, I
          have served as a reporter and associate news editor at The Daily
          Texan, the (awesome) UT student newspaper. I also had the opportunity
          of interning at Houston Public Media, where I dove into daily
          reporting, Ballotpedia, where I learned more about staying objective,
          and KUT, where I worked on a months-long multimedia feature story.
          Through it all, I have stayed committed to pursuing a journalistic
          career that allows me to use my skills to inform, educate and empower
          others. I also strayed from journalism to expand my knowledge on
          skills that could later help my reporting by minoring in government
          and business, along with taking the coding class that allowed me to
          code this website (Hi and thank you, Professor McDonald)! I am eager
          to connect with other professionals in the industry and learn from
          their experiences.
